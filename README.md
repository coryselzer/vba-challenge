This worksheet summarizes stock ticker data from the years 2018-2020.  It breaks down yearly change, percent change and total stock volume for each ticker.  

The script formats the yearly change and percent change columns for color and number format. 

The script reads through the summarized data to find the maximum and minimum percent change value amongst all stock tickers, as well as finds the largest total stock volume ticker.

Once the script finds those values, it then matches those values to the appropriate stock ticker.
